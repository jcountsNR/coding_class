'''
To-Do list
1. You will need to ask the user to input 3 values; (Total bill, number of people, and tip percentage)
2. Calculate the total bill by multiplying the bill by the tip %
3. Divide that total bill by the number of people
4. Print the amount each person should pay

HINT1: Make sure to use the correct type. Inputs are always captured as strings.
HINT2: make sure to form the tip calculation correctly. You don't want to multiply the bill by 10.

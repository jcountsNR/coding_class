# Reference for coding language terms

Syntax - The structure of the language. How the characters are arranged so that the computer understands the request.

Nested - Data or processes inside of other data. This is similar to how a folder works on a PC, there is a master folder (usually C://), then folders are nested under that folder.

Concatinate (concatination) - combining two different pieces of data into one. Primarily used for combining different strings, or variables.

String - A string is a set of characters arranged in a specific order. This includes primarily letters, numbers, and symbols.

Numbers - Numbers in coding are the same as regular numbers. The important note is that numbers are a different character type that strings, and any math done on them must be in the numbers format. ie: 1+1=2, '1'+'1' = '11'.

Boolean - A boolean is a true or false value.

Float - A number that includes decimal places

Variable - A variable is coding shorthand for storing data or processes. A variable with any number of lines can be recalled just by calling on the variable.

List - a list is a set of values, notated by placement. Lists can be either all numbers, or all strings, but not both.

Dictionary - A set of nested key value pairs. Unlike lists, dictionaries can have multiple nested values. Think of a favorite foods list separated into fruits and vegetables.

Loops - A loop is a piece of code that gets repeated. Working loops must have a specified point when that code stops running.

Input - A required value gathered by the user during runtime of the application.

Bug - A part of the code that is not working as expected, and needs to be fixed.

Flooring a number - bringing a float number value to it's lowest decimal place. This does not 'round' in the traditional way, it just removes the numbers past a certain place.

OOP (Object Oriented Programming) - The most common coding language format. Uses objects (or in our case variables) that get passed through programming functions to perform specific tasks. Eventually gets translated to the computer as a binary language.
